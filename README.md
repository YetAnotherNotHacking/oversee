# OverSee
Build status (IDK):
[![Build Executables](https://github.com/YetAnotherNotHacking/oversee/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/YetAnotherNotHacking/oversee/actions/workflows/build.yml)

OverSee is an interactive program written in Python and OpenCV that allows the user to look at several (about 900 at once) webcams all around the world.
The script scrapes data from insecam.org into an ip list file, which the program then reads to show to the user.
The script currently has a matrix view that shows all of the connected cameras all in one frame, as well as a list view that shows each camera individually (in a list obviously).

# Installation
IDFK download main.py and arachnid.py, only use arachnid if you dont have an ip list, run main.py and install the deps or something idfc. I will work on this sooner or later (maybe?
